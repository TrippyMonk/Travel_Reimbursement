# Catoosa County Public Schools Travel Reimbursement Forms

I am working to develop an automated version of our travel reimbursement forms to cut down on employee error.

The project is designed with Bootstrap, and will interact with the Bing Maps API and the Per Diem API from the US General Services Administration.

I am fairly new to web development.  I am confident in my ability to get the work done using imperative programming.  However, I'd like to get it to a more acceptable format of Object-Oriented Programming.  If you happen to review some of the code and have suggestions of how to split it up, I would be very appreciative.

I understand the basics of OOP, I just don't have enough experience to plan a project using the paradigm.
